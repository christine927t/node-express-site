# **Portfolio Site built with Node/Express/Pug**
## *by Christine Treacy*
### Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 6

#### Description/Features: 
Welcome to my portfolio site! This site is my first attempt at server-side JavaScript. I used Node.js, Express and Pug templates to setup a server and routes for landing, about, and projects pages. I also created a friendly 404 page in case a user requests a page that doesn't exist.

## Built With:
**HTML**
**CSS**
**JavaScript**
**Node.js**
**Express**
**Pug**

## CSS changes: 
To make this portfolio look a little more "me" I added some color and gradients to the background, a matching logo. I also changed the look of the 'Live Demo' and 'GitHub Repo' links.

## Future Improvements:
I'd like to continue to improve the design of the site by exploring more fonts, CSS transitions, etc. I'd also like to add social media icons/links on the sidebar.
